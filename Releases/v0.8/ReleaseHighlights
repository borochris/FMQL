RELEASE v0.8 HIGHLIGHTS

Additions since V0.7:
- formalized the query triple of COUNT, SELECT and DESCRIBE
- scaling:
  - indexes used to efficiently query larger systems
  - LIMIT and OFFSET paging added to efficiently walk larger systems
- blank node querying to support FileMan's "subordinate-node-pattern"
- standard projection of the lab file (63.04): query labs like Pharmacy and Radiology
- explicit exposure of VUID and other standard vocabularies
- support for the CIA RPC Broker for connection to standard RPMS

Platform/System support (tested):
- OpenVistA and WorldVistA on (GT/M, Linux) [as before]
- VxVistA (Cache, Windows)
- RPMS (Cache/Windows)
- FOIA VistA (Cache/Windows)

Bug fixes/ reliability:
- "defensive coding": checks the sanity of FileMan arrays at every point in the query process
- removed dependency on the buggy GETS API call. Now goes directly to arrays for all information.

Systems Tested on (other than in-house test VistAs):
the focus was scaling ...
- production VistA with 200K patients, 10M+ documents, 10M+ vitals ...
- de-identified RPMS with full multi-year data of 50K patients
- VxVistA demonstration system (VxVistA is the closest to an in-house VA system)
